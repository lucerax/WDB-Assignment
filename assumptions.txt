Assume fruitniture is added fruit first.
Assume same first character is case-agnostic. So mango and Mirror gives mangoMirror
Assuming we want to keep Stanfurd DB separate and not merge them (which would ideally improve maintainability)
IRL I would sanitize inputs properly ( to prevent SQL injection etc.)

I've decided to keep the fruitnitures stored as their consitutent fruits and furnitures so they can be recombined.
This is mainly because the spec allows you to add Fruitniture but when deleting you delete a Fruit/Furniture
If we move to a consolidated model I would go for one main fruitniture Object (which would be cleaner IMO)

In terms of structure, I've used Flask + SQLAlchemy with a models.py file containing classes and operative functions.
Views.py handles the routing and the HTML is in templates.
